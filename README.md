Curtis and Andrea's Website

Hello and welcome to Curtis and Andrea's website for custom embroidery, keychains and more. This website will consist of some they offer along with pricing. 

In this example website, I will be using HTML, CSS and implementing some JavaScript for functionality. Although this is an example website at the moment, this website will go live when they are ready to launch their business.
